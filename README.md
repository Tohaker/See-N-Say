# Mattel See 'N' Say Story Maker
This project is a recreation of the original 1991 Mattel See 'N' Say Story Maker.

## Installation
Open [the arduino sketch](src/see_n_say.ino) in Arduino Studio and load it onto your Arduino. 
You will most likely have to change the ports unless you used the same Arduino as me - an Arduino Nano.

## Attributions
All code was written by myself from understanding how the toy operated.
Audio was taken from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG8y_e6t0G4) video on Youtube. It is originally copyright of Mattel.

## License
As the audio is not licensed to me, I cannot condone the use of it outside this project.
